Summary
The World Development Indicators (WDI) is a compilation of relevant, high-quality, and internationally comparable statistics about global development and the fight against poverty. The database contains 1,400 time series indicators for 217 economies and more than 40 country groups, with data for many indicators going back more than 50 years.

The aim of this project is to compare different countries based on various development indicators. I chose to compare the countries of the European Union (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) to each other. The indicators I will be making comparisons on are the following:
• Individuals using the Internet (% of population)
• Fixed broadband subscriptions (per 100 people)
• Fixed telephone subscriptions (per 100 people)
• Mobile cellular subscriptions (per 100 people)

I will be looking at 20 years of data from 2001 to 2020.

The aim of the analysis is to see if there’s any correlation between the number of people using the internet and fixed broadband, fixed telephone and mobile cellular subscriptions.

Challenges
The WDI database is huge. There are over 384,000 rows, hundreds of indicators, and lots of missing data.

Process
I imported my csv file to jupyter notebooks and cleaned the data with pandas.
After that I prepared graphs in Tableau and did my final dashboard there.
